**Download all of your content from your Humble Bundle Library!**  

The first time this runs it may take a while because it will download everything.
After that it will only download the content that has been updated or is missing.  


## Features

- support for Humble Trove _(`--trove` flag)_
- downloads new and updated content from your Humble Bundle Library on each run _(only check for updates if using `--update`)_
- cli command for easy use (downloading will also work on a headless system)
- works for SSO and 2FA accounts
- optional progress bar for each item downloaded _(`--progress` flag)_
- optional filter by file types using an include _or_ exclude list _(`--include/--exclude` flag)_
- optional filter by platform types like video, ebook, etc... _(`--platform` flag)_


## Install

`pip install humblebundle-downloader`


## Instructions


### 1. Getting cookies

First thing to do is get your account cookies.
This can be done by getting a browser extension that lets you see or export your cookies.

- **Method 1 (recommended)**
    - Get the value of the cookie called `_simpleauth_sess` and pass that value using `-s "COOKIE_VALUE"`

- **Method 2**
    - Export the cookies in the Netscape format using an extension.  
      If your exported cookie file is not working, it may be a formatting issue.
      This can be fixed by running the command `curl -b cookies.orig.txt --cookie-jar cookies.txt http://bogus`


### 2. Downloading your library

Use the following command to download your Humble Bundle Library:  
```bash
export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace
 hbd -s "<COOKIE_VALUE>" --library-path "Downloaded Library" --progress
unset HISTCONTROL
```
(Please note that the extraneous space before hbd prevents your cookie key from being saved to your machine's history.)

This directory structure will be used:  
`Downloaded Library/Purchase Name/Item Name/downloaded_file.ext`


## Notes

- Inside your library folder a file named `.cache.json` is saved and keeps track of the files that have been downloaded.
  This way running the download command again pointing to the same directory will only download new or updated files.
- Use `--help` with all `hbd` commands to see available options
- Find supported platforms for the `--platform` flag by visiting your Humble Bundle Library
  and look under the **Platform** dropdown
- Download select bundles by using the `-k` or `--keys` flag.
  Find these keys by going to your _Purchases_ section,
  click on a products and there should be a `downloads?key=XXXX` in the url.
